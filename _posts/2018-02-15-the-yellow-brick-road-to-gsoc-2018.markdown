# Prologue
I decided to apply for GSoC last year, when I was at the end of my junior year of university. Despite writing a good proposal that went on to get shortlisted, I didn't manage to get selected. Over the course of a  year, I've pondered over what went wrong and am ready to apply again.

## What the Heck Does GSoC Stand For?
So what exactly is GSoC? It stands for Google Summer of Code, which is one of the most prestigious and and well renowned programs out there. If you do decide to apply, there's a lot to go through, all of which can be very overwhelming at first; finding out the organisation that suits you best, writing the perfect proposal, contributing to an open source project. All of these can get the best of you right before you even get selected!

## A Look Back
Overwhelmed is exactly what I got last year. After sifting through an endless list of organisations, I finally went with an organisation called [teammates](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates). Their project goes by the same name, which is a portal to connect students and their instructors in an easy, user-friendly manner (similar to Moodle). The reason why I did choose this back then, is because it was basically a website and back then I was obsessed with everything HTML, CSS and JS. Little did I know that that's not the only technology used to build a site.

TEAMMATES is built using JSP and JSTL technology. Despite knowing nothing about it back then, I did manage to come up with a proposal. That is by far the easiest part. The toughest part of applying is setting up and understanding unfamiliar code for an entire enterprise level software, which can be confusing at first.

### Everything That Went Wrong
So, you see. My first mistake was not knowing anything about what I was getting into. Back then, I had little idea of technologies and practices used in web development, even from a software engineering point of view.

The second mistake I made was not working on understanding the code. The best way to do this is to contribute and fix issues for the project. Some organisations state this as organisational in their requirements for a proposal, but let me tell you this- *it is absolutely necessary to contribute*.

Another major mistake that I made was not communicating with the mentors throughout my application process. I decided to apply right before the deadline, and didn't get to talk to any of the development team or get opinions on my proposal.

In short, my proposal happened to be well-written, but I had little to no idea what I was talking about. The mentors had no way to assess me either since I had solved next to no issues on their GitHub page. 

## Another Year, Another GSoC Proposal
Therefore, this year, I decided to approach this head first. The first thing I did was set up the server, even before the applications opened. In the following days, I'm going to fix issues, write a proposal, apply and communicate with the developers in hopes of getting selected. I'll document everything here - my thought-process, discoveries, confusions, fixes - in hopes that not only will it clear things up for me, but also help you, dear reader, in the process.
