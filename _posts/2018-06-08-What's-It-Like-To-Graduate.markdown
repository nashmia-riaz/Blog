Holy crap! It has been 4 years already?! Feels like just last week when I started University and anxiously counted down days to my graduation.

When I first got here, I couldn't care less about seecs or my class. My goal was to keep my head down, learn as much as I could, make a few friends and that's it.

Not much has changed today either. I still don't care about seecs or my class; anyone who I barely met and spent time with is off my mind completely. I do worry about my close bunch of friends (all three of them), but then again, I'm not sad about not meeting them every single day. You see, one thing I've learned over the past few years is that friends come and go. There's no point in feeling blue about not seeing your friends everyday again. I've always felt that if you're meant to stay in someone's life, and they're meant to stay in yours, then having common ground doesn't matter. Your friendship shouldn't rely on seeing each other everyday - that's not true friendship. If you're meant to have someone around in the long run, you two find a way. You'll take out time from your busy schedule, no matter how much work is piled up, to meet up and talk every once in a while.

One thing that does hit you when you graduate is the crippling anxiety of what you're going to do next. When I finished my last exam and walked over to the invigilator to hand it in, I had a dreadful realisation. What if I'm unable to follow up on my dreams? What if I don't amount to anything? What if I don't get a job? Or worse, what if I get stuck in a job I hate?

It's a good idea to take things slow. Once I got home and slept this over, I woke up to a brand new feeling of excitement. I've spent 4 years gathering skills that are rare. The world is my oyster. I can do whatever I want. If I don't find a job I like, then I can always tailor make a job for myself. With being in IT, you're not necessarily dependant on big organisations to come sweep you off your feet with a high paid job. You can always find work, freelance for projects, or create your own company. So, this is where I'm at right now. Looking forward to what lies ahead and ready to take over the world.

What I don't look forward too, however, is the change in routine. I won't miss seeing the same faces everyday, but I know I'll hate the change in routine. I don't like the idea of meeting new people. Although I do look forward to making new friends eventually, I've always hated the awkward phase when you're getting to know a whole bunch of new individuals. Hence, while I won't miss seeing my friends and classmates everyday, I will miss the familiarity University had to offer.

Here's to dreading change and anticipating what it had to offer. ðŸ™‚
