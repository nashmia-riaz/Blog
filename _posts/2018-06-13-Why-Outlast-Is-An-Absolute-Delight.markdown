Okay now hear me out. I know Outlast is one of the scariest games of our time. It's one of those games that makes you nauseous just from how frightening it can be at times; it makes you want to quit and watch cute kitten videos on the internet as therapy. But see, that's what makes Outlast a great, delightful game.

I recently went through the main course of Outlast (at normal difficulty, with cheats because I'm a wuss) earlier this year, and am currently in the middle of the DLC - Whistleblower. I can't help but write this blog to rave about everything that the Red Barrels, the studio that made this game, has done right.

I can't help but notice how simple the game mechanic for Outlast is - you run and hide from enemies, use your camera to see them in pitch dark, and that's about it. The enemies themselves are very simple to program - they either chase you around trying to kill you, or they patrol the area in hopes of finding you. Sounds pretty straightforward, right?

This game uses these mechanics cleverly to eventually and slowly strip away any securities you have and leave you to fend for yourself. Outlast is a game that plays YOU, instead of the other way around. It finds ways to always keep you on the edge of your seat, right from the opening sequence.

Right off the bat, it builds an unsettling environment. It's wonderful seeing all teams come together to build what can only be called a masterpiece and nothing less. The sound design, the level design, the chase sequences - everything works in sync like gears of a clock. If your character is frightened, you'll hear his breathing get faster. The music will change from unsettling to nerve wracking as you move from exploring a building to being chased by a lunatic. What makes Outlast scary - and in turn a great game - is the simple fact that everything goes together.

### Spoilers Ahead
Apart from the obvious, let's talk about how this game takes away simple things from your character to leave you terrified.
You'll spend the entire game wandering the halls of this facility, wishing you could just get out. When you do, it's dark and foggy - your camera no longer works. You wish you could go back inside again.

You'll have a path laid out in front of you, but it'll never be so simple. Here, you can see a well-lit area. It's simple, go for the ladder and climb it.

There goes my false sense of security.

For most of the game, the camera is your best friend. With its help, you sneak around in the dark. The game takes its time letting you get comfortable with it, then takes it away from you. You have to go down a dark basement to find it, only to turn it on and realise that you're surrounded by enemies who want to kill you.

When you get comfortable with the surroundings, the game will throw jumpscares at you.

You'll get comfortable with being chased and outrunning your enemies. That's when the game will take away your ability to run. After a series of /ahem/ unfortunate events, you'll find yourself limping, trying to get away from a guy who wants to make you his wife.

See what Outlast does? It plays the player, and does that brilliantly. This is why I'm in awe at this game. It's well thought-out and brilliantly implemented; one of the greatest games of this generation.
