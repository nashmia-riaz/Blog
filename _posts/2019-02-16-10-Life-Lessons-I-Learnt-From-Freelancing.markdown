When I graduated from university a few months ago, I knew that no job in my area was right for me. People were obviously underpaid and overworked, which seemed unfair to me now that I had spent the past 4 years honing a very particular skill. Not only that, I loved to create things and I have ownership to them. Creating for a company that barely cares about me and ends up taking credit for my work seemed wrong, so I decided I'll try out freelancing for a while.

I had already created an account on Upwork, something which is next to impossible nowadays. I fired it up again and got to work.

The first 2-3 months were the hardest as I went from an unstable pay, to making $100 a month. This steadily increased as my profile got more credibility and work experience. I spent hours perfecting all my profiles and their looks to market my services to anyone looking for them. It was a long, unwinding road that taught me a lot of things. Now, with a stable profile and client list, I'm pretty happy with what I've accomplished. It wasn't easy; I had my doubts but chose to stick with freelancing as my first job. I'm sure someone out there is going through the same thing, and maybe you'll come across this little article to help you out.

## 1. It'll Gave Me Confidence
When I was in my final year, I was a complete wuss. Crawled up in my little shell, I didn't have the guts to express myself. I was constantly worried about the consequences of my words. This escalated when I went for interviews; I'd completely blank out during technical questions and didn't do well often. This went into my freelancing as well; when I first started out, I was terrified of interacting with clients. This got better as I interacted with more and more strangers over the internet (you read that right) and it gave me the confidence I terribly needed to interact with people in real life.

## 2. I Figured Out What I Wanted
One of my biggest fears is ending up in a job I hate. Figuring out the right line of work was as vital to me as air. With freelancing, not only did I get exposure that I needed to properly build my portfolio, I figured out in real depth what I really wanted to do from here on out. And not just in a general sense. When I walk into job interviews now, I see them as I, the candidate, interviewing the company to see if they're the right fit for ME. I know what I want, and that my needs matter above that of a company. I know now how to communicate what I want, and if things seem off, I can always reject or leave.

In case you are wondering what I have figured out, I know I want to be a game developer, but I also want to keep my graphic design skills intact. I want to pursue both side by side. I yet have to figure out the right job title for myself, but I know I'll get to it one day. Other than that, I know that I don't want to work for money, but want to work out of sheer passion for what I do. But, I also want money for my work and I want a company to rightly recognise what I do.

## 3. It Gave Me A Safety Net
Like I said above, I now have the option to reject or leave job offers. Another reason why I can do this is because of freelancing. It's something I can always fall back on and pursue.

It's one hell of a safety net. Freelancing gives me the option to be bold; to pursue projects and claim them as my own. Not only that, but it pays well once you get through the hard work. It made me realise that I'm worth a lot more than what companies will have me believe.

## 4. I Had The Chance To Interact With Wonderful People
Most freelancers will have you believe that all clients are bad. I'm here to tell you that that's not true at all! Sure, most clients you run into will be too demanding. Fortunately, you'll run into some amazing people who will make it all worth it.

They'll recognise your work and skills for what they are. They'll notice and appreciate the little things and effort you put in. With me, some of my clients not only understood what I could do, they encouraged me to pursue what I couldn't. They had my back and always rooted for me. It lead me to learn not only some technical skills like coding in languages or working with APIs I never knew I could before, it also taught me non-technical skills like how to communicate professionally but also care about people. Something I never would have learned otherwise.

## 5. I Realised My Worth
Let's be real. When you first start out, you'll probably have to build a respectable profile on an online platform. It'll take time, and you'll have to work dirt cheap for ratings. Once you get past all that, you'll meet people who are willing to retain you and pay well above what everyone else would. Just like what I talked about above, good clients will realise what you're worth and help you do so in the process. They'll constantly love your work and take you to new heights with them.

## 6. I Can Work From Anywhere
When I say this, I don't mean you can constantly travel and go on vacation while you work and earn. Let me explain.

Currently as I write this, I'm applying for Masters programs abroad. I'm happy that I chose freelancing as now I know that I can work from anywhere. I know that I can take care of myself and my clients will follow me wherever I go. It also opened up new doors for me as now I can take up all my clients and even create a startup of my own.

I know that my dreams don't have to wait for anything and I can pursue my life goals head on.

## 7. I Learned Things I Never Would Have
I've already talked about all the things I have learned with freelancing, but let's delve deeper into the topic.

With every new project, I learned something that I proved useful to me at some point. No matter how small of a contract, I took away something from all of them. I'd take up projects with little to now idea how to do them (I'd express this to my clients as well) and learn something entirely new in the process. If it weren't for these projects, I don't think I'd ever have the motivation to learn these things on my own. I already have so many personal projects that are left unfinished.

With this came a new can-do attitude. I believe that if I put enough time and effort into my personal goals and be persistent, then I can achieve anything. I have evidence of this. I started out small with no clients, dreaming to have an established profile with a good rating. I wanted steady flow of new clients, retained long-term clients and a stable income every month. It took me a lot of time and a lot of effort, but I finally have something that resembles that closely.

## 8. My Passion Motivates Me
As a freelancer, you'll work on your own and be your own boss. No one will tell you when to work, which seems great as a prospect. Unfortunately, with no one to whip you into work, you'll find it hard to motivate yourself to do so.

This is much easier if you pursue something you're passionate about. With the right kind of work and fair amount of pay, you'll find yourself eager to get back to work. The heart and soul you'll pour into your projects will be recognised by clients as well, and will keep you in business. So, it's important to pursue something you like. Don't worry if it's something that seems too small. Believe me, there is someone out there looking for YOU and your skill. You just have to get to them.

## 9. Personal Time Is Important
The outlook of earning hourly pay for work seems amazing. It's easy to get lost in that and over work yourself.

It's important to realise that free time and breaks are essential to working properly. You're on your own; you have only yourself to motivate you or to tell you when you need to chill. Take a break, play with you pets, go out for a walk. Just walk away from your laptop for once in a while. It's not only important for your mental and physical health, but a clear mind will help you work better.

## 10. How To Market Myself & My Skills
I'm an introvert and for me, the hardest part of it all was publishing my work online. It was mostly a personal thing; my personal projects had been for me. They were special and I didn't want anyone else to see them. I know it sounds weird, but I think (read hope) there are others like me out there.

I started putting my work online and sharing it in proposals. Behance, GitHub, a personal online resume that no one would ever open. Heck, as I write this blog, I have never shared the link to it with anyone. This is strictly for me; something similar to a personal diary.

Feedback on my profiles from close friends led me to polish it up a bit. Soon, people I had never met would go through my work appreciating it. This seemed invasive to me at first, but I eventually came to terms with it. Now, I'm happy that people out there like my work.

What I actually learned though, was this. I had to properly present my work and the thought I had put into it. I'd assume people going through it had no idea what my work actually served or what it was for. I'd explain every step and every detail step by step. I did my own branding and followed it to the bone. I researched this, read articles and followed them through. I put up personal photos of myself as display pictures to not only humanise myself and my work to clients, but also give them the impression that I'm friendly and approachable (which I totally am, I promise).

## TL;DR?
It's tough starting out as a freelancer. You have to be incredibly persistent. But once you get through it, you'll learn some wonderful things. You'll find yourself, your purpose, your worth. You'll gain a new found confidence and attitude towards everything you pursue and will have the guts to do so. I hope this post helps you in some way. All the best!
