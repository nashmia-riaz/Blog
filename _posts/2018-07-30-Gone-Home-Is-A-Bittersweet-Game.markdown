You may or may not have heard of Gone Home. It's an indie exploration game that came out for consoles and PCs in the summer of 2013. The game has you play as 21-year-old Katie Greenbriar, who gets home from a trip to Europe (I assume) only to find her home completely empty.

Now, I have an old laptop. Somehow, I've always been technologically behind by a couple of years. Which is why I only stumbled upon this game recently. It took me a little over an hour or two to get to the end of this game. I wasn't exactly thorough, since I'm not a huge fan of adventure exploration games. Not since Firewatch. Gone Home left me with a feeling similar to when I finished Firewatch. I was disappointed with the end, how ordinary everything turned out to be. That is, up until I took a closer look.

Now, I write this review from two perspectives; as a game developer and as a game player. Let's get to the obvious first.

## The Bitter Part
When I look at this game from the perspective of the player, it leaves me feeling immensely ordinary. You see, when someone plays a video game, they want to escape reality; the reality of their life, or maybe the reality of life in general. They play so they can do extraordinary things and be a hero, essentially. This is exactly why Life Is Strange worked so well, which I consider the high budget counterpart of Gone Home. It gave their players a superpower and made them the hero (kind of).

So when you play Gone Home, and you realize how it depicts normal, ordinary, boring life; where people don't have superpowers or leap from buildings or save the princess from bad guys, you feel like it had all been a waste of time. You expect more from this game, just as you did from Firewatch. You expected the house to be haunted. For there to be monsters and you to save your family from them, who had all been huddled up in a room to keep safe in a huge, confusing, maze of a house. Sadly, you end up disappointed as none of that happens. Heck, you expect that Sam had committed some kind of suicide pact with her girlfriend, and that you'd find her body in the attic. That doesn't happen either.

If that is all you took away from this game when you played it, that it's disappointing and amounts to nothing more than a averagely rated game, then I feel kind of sad for you.

## The Sweet Part
There is a lot more to Gone Home then what meets the eye. For one, it has beautiful art design. All be it, only the house had to be designed, but the UI design, the audio design, how the voice actor for Sam narrates through her journals, is breathtaking for an indie game.

One thing that people don't notice about games is the sheer amount of effort that goes into them and making them work. How a bunch of people with different fields and different professions come together to create a great piece of entertainment, where every aspect compliments each other, is a wonderful statement to team work. And boy, did the team work for Gone Home.

Gone Home imitates real life, where the extraordinary doesn't happen, and it does so wonderfully. Imagine getting home to your huge family mansion from a vacation abroad, only to find it empty with no sign of life. There's a thunder crackling outside and the occasional roar of lightning makes you jumpy. You expect to see ghosts, or monsters, or vampires, with every corridor you turn. You swear you just saw something in the corner of your eye, only for it to be the curtains moving under the wind. This is the exact behaviour Gone Home brings out in its player, And it does this so brilliantly, so subtly, that once you become aware of these mechanics, it leaves you speechless. The house is set up messily, lights in every room you enter are off, the old house creeks occasionally. You come across an ouija board and some kind of ritual to summon a ghost, and you swear that what you saw out of the corner of your eye was real and you weren't jumpy for no reason. Yet, the game wasn't going out of its way to creep you out. No ghosts pop out, there is nothing in your peripheral vision. It's just you wandering through an old, big, empty house.

Another thing that makes Gone Home so great are the character it builds, and how it builds them. You find out about the parents and their frustrations, especially the dad's, through subtle hints, notes, rejection letters throughout the game. There's a rejection letter under a bar where dad has been drinking. Crumpled up papers with book ideas scrawled on them, a big pin-board with the letters "you can do better" scrawled on them.

Undoubtedly, the best part about this game was Sam. The narration was on point, and the experiences this character feels as a teenager seemed all too real. They even went as far out to give Sam an impeccable taste in music. You can't help but feel close to her, almost like a big sister, and eventually worry that she might be dead (spoiler: she isn't).

## To Sum It Up
By indie standards, Gone Home is great. It relies heavily on its story and builds it up perfectly. I might still feel underwhelmed by the ending, but I think that's on me. As a game, Gone Home is amazing, and the developers did a great job.
