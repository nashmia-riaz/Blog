# GSoC 2018 - Moment of Truth
I waited anxiously for 9:00 p.m. on a Monday night. I had a feeling I wouldn't get selected, as I had not received any hint of an email from Teammates like I did last year when my proposal got shortlisted. Still, I thought to myself that there's a 50:50 chance I might get selected (wishful thinking now that I look back on it).

Just as I had expected, I didn't make it. However, the experience left me with some wisdom; it helped me grow in many different ways.

## What I Learned
### First impressions are everything
Now that I look back, I know that my first impression didn't come off as great. My stumbling around with code on a public, professoinal forum left me looking like a fool. Though I did learn a lot and ended up a more competant programmer than when I started, I was aware of the fact that the contributors didn't know this.

### Open Source sucks
This may come as a surprise to some, but Open Source sucks. Companies that make open source software try to regulate coding standards. But this rarely happens. During my experience, the contributors themselves were confused about some of the coding styles; files had different implementations of coding style in place and contributors would recommend conflicting styles themselves. It's hard to take care of such small issues while trying to write code as well. I went over this back and forth, which ultimately contributed to my bad first impression.

### Communication is hard
Communicating over the internet with people you've never met is difficult. You can easily leave a bad impression and come off as a person you aren't in real life.

In the end, my work wasn't up to the standard that was required by GSoC. Now that I ponder over this, I realise that I wasn't ready as a programmer to move on to Open Source itself.

## What I Need to Learned
As I move on from my GSoC rejection towards my graduation, I've realised that my CV is all over the place. Without a job in sight (mainly due to not coming across a company I like), I need to focus my next few months working on strengthening my CV to favor my interests. My main interest right now is game development and everything it encompasses. So I might try making a few games in the next few months. There are a lot of things I need to learn for this.

Another thing I'm interested in is web development. After much research, I've decided to learn Angular in depth as it's a major requirement by tech companies today.

Signing off on GSoC 2018 now. Hope this thread has helped someone. :)
