# Day 15+
My approach for the solution was correct, but I kept stumbling along the way and the reviewer kept requesting minor changes to fix. In the meantime, I tried finding some other issues but couldn't find anything substantial. I tweaked around with their code and reported some minor bugs as well, which helped me further my understanding of the project and its code.

However, I still kept making errors in my code - errors that didn't effect the behaviour or functionality, but didn't follow the best coding practice. After spending some time each week to correct my silly mistakes, I learned some quite useful lessons.

### Lesson 1: Be Your Best
Coding for an open-source project is not as easy as it sounds. Sure, it's open source so they take any help they get, but that doesn't mean they'll accept just about any quality of code. Try to apply the best coding practices that you've learnt, some of which that I ignored happened to be basic ones like avoiding redundancy and using proper variable and function names. Open source projects are still professional, enterprise level of softwares. They will accept the help you've to offer, but they want YOU to meet their quality standards.

### Lesson 2: Plan Ahead
You need to write code that is well thought-out. Try to pace yourself and not to rush things. You can plan an approach before you implement it, and it might be correct, but try to find 2-3 different approaches before you commit and push your changes. Your approach might not be the best one, so getting your friend to review it in case you get a bad case of coder's block (see what I did there?) might help as well.

### Lesson 3: Pace Yourself & Test Everything
Coding for such projects can be overwhelming. You must take care of your programming skills AND communicate well with people sitting half way across the world. In the middle of all this, you might want to rush things and commit and push your changes, only to find out that the tests didn't even pass. Therefore, always ALWAYS test before you push your changes. You may think that the tests may pass as you had not made changes to some files, but you'd be surprised. It also leaves a bad impression if the reviewers have to keep pointing out your mistakes (not to mention how embarrassing that is).

### Lesson 4:  Take a Leap of Faith
Applying for programs like GSoC can be overwhelming (I've lost count of how many times I've used that word). When the deadline passes and you're waiting for the results to be announced, it gets hard to find good issues to solve. The main contributors may be busy reviewing your proposal, and your fellow applicants may be hogging all the issues. It's good to act fast and take any issue you can get head first and figure out how to do it later. Some may argue that this is a bad idea, but at a time like this it's very essential to show the contributors that you're committed to work and are able to solve issues. Quality, as well as quantity here, can make a huge difference. I've seen people report bugs and assign them to themselves immediately (which, in my opinion, is a sad and desperate move. Don't do this :P). Take what you can get, and don't comment asking for permission. Issues may have been reported by people like you, who may not even reply to you before someone sweeps in and takes your issue. It's like the wild West out here - etiquettes like dibs do not exist here.

### Lesson 5: If You Can't Do, Then Report
If you find yourself out of issues to solve, try tweaking with the project and reporting bugs on the forum. These count as contribution as well and show the owners that you have been working on project regardless. It also gives the impression that you understand how the code is supposed to work, and are able to point out when it behaves out of line.
