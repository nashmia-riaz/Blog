# The Role of Computer Games and Their Influence on Society

Computer games have been around for decades by now. Starting with the first video game in the 1970s, the introduction of console games in the 1980s and eventually the boom of computer games in the 2000s, computer games have undoubtedly had an impact on our society. With contributions to technology, the role it plays in behaviour reconstruction of youngsters as well as it's subtle impact on social media, computer games have much evolved from their early 8-bit ancestors into life-altering experiences today.

## Computer Games - Good or Bad?

Perhaps the most popular debate of our generation is whether computer games have a good or bad affect on young minds. It is understandable to say that computer games have a negative influence on children; that the violent acts depicted in them desentisize young minds and that they leave a lasting urge amongst youngsters to carry out horrific acts of violent nature. Probably the most famous case in favor of this was the 'Manhunt' inspired murder in England in 2004. However, the statistics to support this claim often don't add up. A 2015 journal titled 'Does Media Violence Predict Societal Violence? It Depends on What You Look at and When' concluded that more often than not, spike in violent computer games was negatively correlated with violence in real life.

Another fact evident from computer games is that they can be both relaxing and boost reaction times among players. People that start playing games at an earlier age often have good learning skills and catch up on new things quickly. Computer games are also quickly evolving to help better our society. WIth the introduction of Virtual Reality, nowadays games can be used to run simulations, train professionals and even help people get past their demons. Recently in 2017, VR was used to help veterans with their PTSD.

## Impact on Technology

In addition to advanced programming needs to run high-end algorithms, one of the reasons that substituted to the technology boom was the need to run high-end computer games. Computers advanced rapidly since early 2000s in order to support more realistic graphics in games being released every year. With games being a billion dollar industry, it's only logical that GPU producers would want to keep up with the needs of the gaming community. Eventually, we have ended here in the year 2018, where graphics in computer games are at their peak and VR is proving to be the next big thing. Speaking of which, a ton of new technology, including VR, has been developed to support video games. With the rise of Oculus Rift, companies have moved on to develop more pieces of technology that will fully immerse the user into their virtual video games. New methods are being perfected, such as forced feedback gloves and walking platform, that will eventually put the user into their computer games. Who says computer games have had no impact on technology?

Another way computer games have impacted our society, and our technology, is with the technology of the future often depicted in them. Future as depicted by popular movies and games often shape the expectations of the mass population. This eventually leads companies to design their products in order to meet these expectations. We're now moving towards wearable tech - smart watches, smart AR glasses, smart shoes even. In addition to this, we're near the release of fully bezelless smartphones, as well as the eventual release of 'glass phones' (fully see-through smartphones). All of these had once been envisioned and popularised by video games such as Dead Space and Deus Ex.

## Social Media and Computer Games

How we interact on social media has vastly changed since the early 2000s. One of the reasons for this is, you guessed it, computer games. Where one would go on social media to make new friends, we can now simply log in to our favorite multiplayer game to meet new people. Not only this, but with introduction of highly addictive games into our social media (such as Farmville), people now interact differently with their social media friends as well. Computer games nowadays can make or break friendships.

## Computer Games and Society

It is evident that computer games have had a good impact on our society. They have helped advance people in their respective field of work, helped raise an intellectual youth as well as had an influence on our pop culture and media today, which is obvious from the rise of 80s culture and its video games once again. It's hard to envision our past, present and future without the contirbutive role computer games have played to shape our society.
