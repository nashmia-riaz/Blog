Oh, hello there! So glad that you've stumbled upon this little blog of mine.

So a little bit about me: I am currently a student in Pakistan, doing my bachelors in Software Engineering. I like to code, draw digital illustrations and play games whenever I get time to. Currently, I am an aspiring game developer, graphic designer and animator (aka a jack of all trades). I am the kind of person who sees details in the little things and believes that presentation is key, which is why I like integrating good aesthetics into all my work. Oh, and also, I loooooove cats (a good conversation starter if you ever want to talk to me).

## Contact
Feel free to hit me up on on my [hotmail](mailto::nashmia-riaz@hotmail.com) (yes, I still use hotmail :C). You can also find me on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NashmiaRiaz) and [github](https://github.com/nashmia-riaz).

Thanks for stopping by!
